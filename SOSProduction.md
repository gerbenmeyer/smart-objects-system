# SOSProduction #

SOSProduction is the second application developed with the Smart Objects Systems framework. This application is the implementation of a manufacturer agent, which participated in the TAC SCM simulated supply chain competition of 2009.

Binaries of the agent which participated in the competition, as well as the altered TAC SCM servers which have been used for additional simulations, can be found at http://code.google.com/p/smart-objects-system/downloads/list.

The source code of this application can be found at [http://code.google.com/p/smart-objects-system/source/browse/](http://code.google.com/p/smart-objects-system/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FSOSProduction).
