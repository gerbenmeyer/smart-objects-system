=System behaviour=
This page explains the behaviour of SOS in three different cases. These cases are: a data client adding a new object, a user requesting the web interface, and a user training an agent. Each will be discussed next.

The figure below shows a UML communication diagram, indicating the different steps and function calls between classes required when a data client is adding a new object.
